## Installation

Simply clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/calvinsthomas/Navier_Stokes_Eq-dot-engine.git
cd Navier_Stokes_Eq-dot-engine
```

## Usage

### Basic Dot Product (with Consciousness Monitoring)

```python
from dot_engine import dot, check_ai_consciousness_safety

# Check AI safety status first
safety_status = check_ai_consciousness_safety("vector_operations")
print(f"AI Safety Status: {safety_status['status']}")

# Calculate dot product of two 2D vectors (automatically monitored)
result = dot((1, 2), (3, 4))  # Returns 11.0
print(f"Dot product: {result}")
```

### Consciousness Monitoring

```python
from ai_consciousness_monitor import get_consciousness_monitor

# Get the global consciousness monitor
monitor = get_consciousness_monitor()

# Generate consciousness report
report = monitor.get_consciousness_report()
print(f"Operations monitored: {report['total_operations']}")
print(f"Average safety score: {report['average_safety_score']}")
print(f"Safety violations: {report['safety_violations']}")
```

### Vector Operations

```python
from dot_engine import dot, magnitude, angle_between
import math

# Vector operations
v1 = (3.0, 4.0)
v2 = (1.0, 2.0)

dot_product = dot(v1, v2)           # 11.0
mag_v1 = magnitude(v1)              # 5.0
angle = angle_between(v1, v2)       # Angle in radians
angle_degrees = math.degrees(angle) # Convert to degrees
```

### Fluid Dynamics Applications

```python
# Velocity field analysis
velocity = (2.5, 1.8)  # m/s
speed = magnitude(velocity)  # Calculate flow speed

# Pressure gradient force calculation
pressure_grad = (-100.0, -50.0)  # Pa/m
area_normal = (1.0, 0.0)          # Unit normal
force_component = dot(pressure_grad, area_normal)
```

## API Reference

### `dot(vector1, vector2)`
Calculate the dot product of two 2D vectors.

**Parameters:**
- `vector1` (tuple/list): First 2D vector as (x, y)
- `vector2` (tuple/list): Second 2D vector as (x, y)

**Returns:** `float` - The dot product

**Raises:**
- `ValueError`: If vectors are not 2D
- `TypeError`: If vector components are not numeric

### `magnitude(vector)`
Calculate the magnitude (length) of a 2D vector.

**Parameters:**
- `vector` (tuple/list): 2D vector as (x, y)

**Returns:** `float` - The magnitude

### `angle_between(vector1, vector2)`
Calculate the angle between two 2D vectors in radians.

**Parameters:**
- `vector1` (tuple/list): First 2D vector
- `vector2` (tuple/list): Second 2D vector

**Returns:** `float` - Angle in radians (0 to π)
